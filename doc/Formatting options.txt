MATLAB provides a number of format commands. each of them begins with the keyword format


 short: All floating-point output has at least one whole number, a decimal
point, and four decimal values, such as 4.2000.

 long: All floating-point output has at least one whole number, a decimal
point, and 15 decimal values, such as 4.200000000000000.

 shorte: All floating-point output uses exponential format with four
decimal places, such as 4.2000e+00.

 longe: All floating-point output uses exponential format with 15 decimal
places, such as 4.200000000000000e+00.

 shortg: All output uses a short general format, such as 4.2, with five
digits of space.

 long: All output uses a long general format, such as 4.2, with 15 digits of
space.

shorteng: All floating-point output uses exponential format with four
decimal places and powers in groups of three, such as 4.2000e+000.

 longeng: All floating-point output uses exponential format with 14 decimal
places and powers in groups of three, such as 4.20000000000000e+000.

 hex: All output is in hexadecimal format, such as 4010cccccccccccd.

 +: All output is evaluated for positive or negative values, so that the
result contains just a + or - sign, such as + when using the formula 2 * 2.1.

 bank: All output provides two decimal places, even for integer calcula-
tions, such as 4.20.
