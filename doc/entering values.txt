Entering values inside square brackets:

b=[5,6]
gives the output

b = 
	5 	6


The information is stored as a list of two numbers. Each number is treated as a separate value. 



b=[5;6]
gives the output
b=
	5
	6
same as previous, but different arrangement


Transposing matrices with an apostrophe:
Using the colon creates row vectors. However, sometimes you need a column
vector instead. To create a column vector, you end the input with an apostro-
phe. To see how this works for yourself, type h=[5:0.5:10]’ 

h =
5.0000
5.5000
6.0000
6.5000
7.0000
7.5000
8.0000
8.5000
9.0000
9.5000
10.0000
